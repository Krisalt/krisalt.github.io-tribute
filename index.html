    <h3>Biography</h3>
    
  <div class="container">
    <div class="col-md-12">
    <p>Michael Faraday was born in 1791 in London.  His youth was marked by avid curiosity about the world around him.  When 13 years old, he was apprenticed to a bookbinders’ shop in town, where he was able to read to his heart’s content.  Faraday found interest in the idea of the forces of Nature and how energy worked. </p>
  
    <p>In 1821, Faraday attended his first scientific lecture, a great showman and chemist named Humphrey Davy.  By 1823, Faraday was Davy’s assistant and his love of experimentation would yield many great discoveries in chemistry and physics. </p>
  
    <p> He married in 1821 to a woman he met through his church.  He turned down several appointments to the Royal Society and a knighthood, citing religious moral against material wealth.  He passed away in 1867 at the age of 75.  </p>
  
    <p>Despite his successes, Faraday was a humble man, one of both faith and science. His legacy inspired many scientists, including Einstein, who was said to have a portrait of Faraday hanging on his study wall.  </p>
